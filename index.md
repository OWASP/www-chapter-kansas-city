## OWASP Kansas City

## Our Chapter

_OWASP-KCâ€™s mission is to be a welcoming community for Web Application Developers and Information Security Professionals to learn, communicate, and share their perspectives at a common table._

#### Our chapter is currently on hiatus until the beginning of 2021, at which point we will re-evaluate the COVID-19 situation and weigh the potential for virtual or in-person meetings.   

The best way to stay up-to-date with our chapter is to join our [Meetup Group](https://www.meetup.com/OWASP-Kansas-City)!  We will post all our updates there.  In addition, you can [follow us on Twitter at @OWASPKC!](https://twitter.com/owaspkc/).

Financial contributions should only be made online using the authorized online donation button. To be a SPEAKER at ANY OWASP Chapter in the world simply review the [speaker agreement](/www-policy/speaker-agreement) and then contact the local chapter leader with details of what OWASP Project, independent research, or related software security topic you would like to present.
